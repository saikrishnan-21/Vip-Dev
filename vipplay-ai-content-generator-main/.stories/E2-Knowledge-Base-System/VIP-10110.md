**Story ID**: VIP-10110
**Story Type**: Story
**Epic**: E2-Knowledge-Base-System
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 3
**Status**: To Do

## User Story

As a user, I want to see articles grouped by source so that I can review what was captured

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: GET endpoint retrieves articles for a specific source with pagination
- [ ] **AC2**: Articles are returned with proper sorting (newest first by default)
- [ ] **AC3**: Response includes pagination metadata (total count, page info)
- [ ] **AC4**: Filtering by date range is supported
- [ ] **AC5**: Only user's own articles are returned (auth check)

## Technical Details

**Backend API:**
- Create `GET /api/sources/{sourceId}/articles` endpoint
- JWT authentication middleware required
- Verify source ownership before returning articles

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit` (default: 20, max: 100) - Number of articles per page
- `offset` (default: 0) - Pagination offset
- `sort` (default: "publishedAt", options: "publishedAt", "createdAt", "title") - Sort field
- `order` (default: "desc", options: "asc", "desc") - Sort order
- `startDate` (optional) - Filter articles published after this date
- `endDate` (optional) - Filter articles published before this date

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  articles: ArticlePublic[],
  pagination: {
    total: number,
    limit: number,
    offset: number,
    hasMore: boolean
  }
}
```

**ArticlePublic Interface:**
```typescript
{
  _id: string,
  sourceId: string,
  userId: string,
  title: string,
  content: string,
  summary?: string,
  url?: string,
  author?: string,
  publishedAt?: Date,
  fetchedAt: Date,
  imageUrl?: string,
  tags?: string[],
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Error Handling:**

- 404: Source not found
- 500: Database error
